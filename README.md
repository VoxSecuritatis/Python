# Python Portfolio
Published: 2025-10-01 | Updated: 2025-10-06

Python is one of the most versatile programming languages in the world, powering everything from simple scripts to large-scale machine learning systems. This page is a showcase of my work with Python, reflecting both technical capability and applied problem-solving. Each project emphasizes not just code, but design principles, maintainability, and integration with modern tools such as AI support libraries.

I have focused on building projects that highlight real-world applicability, demonstrate mastery of Pythonâ€™s ecosystem, and integrate advanced features such as **data visualization**, **automation**, and **AI-enhanced applications**. These projects are structured with best practices in mind: clear documentation, modular code, version control, and reproducibility across environments (Windows, PowerShell, VSCode, GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Models, and Google Colab).

## Core Areas of Focus

### Data Analysis and Visualization
Pythonâ€™s powerful data stack (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) enables deep analysis of datasets. My projects demonstrate how to transform raw data into actionable insights and polished visual outputs, suitable for both technical and business audiences.

### Automation and Robust Scripting
Beyond simple scripts, I emphasize robust, reusable modules with clear error handling, configuration management, and cross-platform compatibility. This ensures my projects are production-ready while remaining easy to adapt for new use cases.

### Integration with AI
One of the unique aspects of my Python work is **AI integration**. By incorporating AI-assisted guidance, I ensure the tools I develop donâ€™t just produce numbersâ€”they also interpret them, contextualize them, and tie results to best practices. This blend of automation and intelligence allows my projects to stand out as both **practical** and **insightful**.

## Highlights of My Python Work

- Designed modular Python codebases with **clear separation of concerns** (drivers, utilities, configuration).  
- Implemented **data quality pipelines** that detect missing values, duplicates, outliers, and schema issues.  
- Automated **report generation** using HTML with embedded charts and AI-informed best practice recommendations.  
- Integrated environment-aware workflows to support both **local development** and **cloud/Colab execution**.  
- Leveraged AI support to provide **interpretability and recommendations** alongside raw statistical output.  
- Demonstrated expertise in **GitHub workflows**: commits, branching, `.gitignore` management, and version tagging.

## Featured Project

ðŸ“Œ **[Data Quality Analyzer (DQA)](https://github.com/VoxSecuritatis/data-quality-analyzer)**  

The **Data Quality Analyzer (DQA)** is a Python-based application that automatically analyzes CSV datasets for quality issues and produces professional HTML reports. It showcases my ability to integrate Python with AI-driven guidance, ensuring results are not only correct but also actionable.  

## Other Projects

**[Tech Jargon Buster](https://github.com/VoxSecuritatis/Project-AI-tech-jargon-buster)**

**Tech Jargon Buster** is a Streamlit application that simplifies IT and cybersecurity terms into clear, plain-English explanations. It connects to multiple advanced Large Language Models via GitHub Models to provide side-by-side comparisons enriched with real-world analogies.
The project demonstrates practical AI integration, secure token management, and multi-model orchestration in a single, user-friendly platform.

**[Transcriber](https://github.com/VoxSecuritatis/Project-Python-AI-Transcriber)**

**Transcriber** is an AI-powered audio assistant that connects directly to **ChatGPT** through the OpenAI API.  It intelligently handles large MP3 recordings by automatically splitting them into manageable segments, sending each one to the language model for accurate transcription.  

Once all parts are processed, **Transcriber** seamlessly merges them into a single, polished master transcript â€” then goes a step further by generating **concise, structured study notes** from the content.  In just one run, you receive both a **complete transcript** and **ready-to-use notes**, turning hours of audio into clear, insightful summaries for students, professionals, and lifelong learners alike.
